![Chain Line](http://d.pr/f/Oo2c4f+)

Get anything to anywhere, powered by the blockchain. Chain Line uses a network of untrusted peers to get products and valuable items to their destinations with near-zero risk.

Behind Chain Line is a bold vision: to introduce a modern peer-to-peer courier platform to address the needs of shipping companies and individuals alike, powered entirely by a smart contract.

It works by re-assigning an item's cost between peers as it travels through the system. A central "hub" contract controls "reserved funds" in Chain Line user wallets running custom verification scripts. Chain Line features a user reputation system and relies on no external "oracle" systems, operating entirely on the blockchain.
